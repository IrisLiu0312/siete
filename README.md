Siente y medio 

Filenames: cards.h, cards.cpp, main.cpp

Purpose: Simulation of the siente y medio card game on C++. Players are allocated a starting budget with which they can make bets for round of the game. The game is played in a similar fashion to American casino blackjack, except instead of 21, the target number of seven and a half. Each round of the game is also recorded in a text file. The game ends when the player goes bankrupt or the dealer loses a cumulative (not net) amount of $900.
